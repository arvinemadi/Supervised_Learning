## Probability calibration for unbalanced data classification
Dataset: [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635.pdf)

Two probability calibration methods of Platt and Beta are used to calibrate the scores from three models. The three models tried for the binary classification in this unbalanced dataset are Random Forrest, a NN with three dense layers, and a Logistic Regression.

## Bayesian Neural Network
A simple BNN for multiclass classification is demonstrated.

Some of the theory behind BNN at high level is shown in the notebook. Reference given to [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06823.pdf).
BNN is a powerful tool to use when the amount of available training data is small and we want to avoid overfitting. Also the uncertainities in the predictions can be estimated which make them popular for predictions in critical applications.
