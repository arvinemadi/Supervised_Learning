## Probability calibration for unbalanced data classification
Dataset: [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635.pdf)

Two probability calibration methods of Platt and Beta are used to calibrate the scores from three models. The three models tried for the binary classification in this unbalanced dataset are Random Forrest, a NN with three dense layers, and a Logistic Regression.
